Data Analytics Portfolio
Overview

This repository contains end-to-end data analytics projects focused on finance and business decision-making.
Each project is designed to simulate real analytical problems, using SQL to build databases, perform analysis, and extract actionable insights.

Core focus areas:

Financial risk analysis

Fraud detection

Retail performance analytics

Primary tools:
SQL (MySQL / PostgreSQL compatible), relational data modeling, analytical querying, business interpretation.

Projects
1) Bank Loan Risk Analysis
Business Problem

Financial institutions face losses due to loan defaults.
The objective of this project is to analyze borrower and loan attributes to assess default risk and identify high-risk segments.

Data Description

Customer demographic data

Loan characteristics

Repayment / default indicators

Data is structured using a relational database schema.

Tools & Technologies

SQL

Relational database design

Aggregations, joins, conditional logic

Methodology

Designed and created the loan database schema

Cleaned and structured loan and customer data

Analyzed default patterns across borrower segments

Identified risk drivers based on historical behavior

Key Insights

Certain borrower segments show disproportionately higher default rates

Loan size and repayment history are strong indicators of risk

Risk concentration can be reduced through better segmentation

Business Impact

Enables risk-based lending decisions

Can support credit policy refinement and loss reduction
