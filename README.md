## Bank Loan Risk Analysis

### Business Problem
Financial institutions incur losses due to loan defaults.  
This project analyzes borrower and loan attributes to assess default risk and identify high-risk segments.

### Data Description
- Customer demographic information
- Loan characteristics
- Repayment and default indicators

### Tools Used
- SQL
- Relational database modeling
- Joins, aggregations, conditional logic

### Methodology
- Designed and created a loan database schema
- Structured and cleaned loan-related data
- Analyzed default patterns across borrower segments
- Identified key risk drivers

### Key Insights
- Certain borrower segments show higher default rates
- Loan size and repayment history are strong risk indicators
- Risk concentration can be reduced through segmentation

### Business Impact
- Supports risk-based lending decisions
- Can be used to refine credit approval policies
